| RunID | Files touched | Tests added | Root Cause | Fix Summary |
|-------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 18274745982 | CHANGELOG.md; tests/Feature/MessageVisibilityTest.php; TRACEABILITY.md | n/a (lint-only) | Pint failed because imports in MessageVisibilityTest lacked a blank line between class and function groups. | Inserted the required blank line between import groups and documented the lint fix. |
| 18219198113 | .github/workflows/ci.yml; CHANGELOG.md; config/database.php; pint.json; tests/Feature/DatabaseConfigTest.php; TRACEABILITY.md | tests/Feature/DatabaseConfigTest.php (2 tests) | Pint preset unsupported and database credentials mismatched with CI services, breaking lint and migrations. | Switched Pint to a supported preset, aligned CI MySQL/PostgreSQL secrets with Laravel config fallbacks, and added regression tests. |
| 18217747108 | package.json; tests/Unit/BuildConfigTest.php; CHANGELOG.md; TRACEABILITY.md | `tests/Unit/BuildConfigTest.php` (2 tests) | Node treated vite.config.js as CommonJS, so the ESM-only laravel-vite-plugin crashed the build. | Declared the project `type` as `module` and added tests guarding the ESM requirement. |
| local-php-artisan-test | .env.testing; phpunit.xml.dist; CHANGELOG.md; TRACEABILITY.md | Existing suite (`php artisan test`) | Missing `.env` forced the test runner to read MySQL secrets that are absent in CI. | Added a committed `.env.testing` profile and forced SQLite in PHPUnit to eliminate external dependencies. |
