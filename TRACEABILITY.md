| 18217747108 | package.json; tests/Unit/BuildConfigTest.php; CHANGELOG.md; TRACEABILITY.md | `tests/Unit/BuildConfigTest.php` (2 tests) | Node treated vite.config.js as CommonJS, so the ESM-only laravel-vite-plugin crashed the build. | Declared the project `type` as `module` and added tests guarding the ESM requirement. |
| local-php-artisan-test | .env.testing; phpunit.xml.dist; CHANGELOG.md; TRACEABILITY.md | Existing suite (`php artisan test`) | Missing `.env` forced the test runner to read MySQL secrets that are absent in CI. | Added a committed `.env.testing` profile and forced SQLite in PHPUnit to eliminate external dependencies. |
