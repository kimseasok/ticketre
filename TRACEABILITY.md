| RunID | Files touched | Tests added | Root Cause | Fix Summary |
|-------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 18274745982 | CHANGELOG.md; tests/Feature/MessageVisibilityTest.php; TRACEABILITY.md | n/a (lint-only) | Pint failed because imports in MessageVisibilityTest lacked a blank line between class and function groups. | Inserted the required blank line between import groups and documented the lint fix. |
| 18219198113 | .github/workflows/ci.yml; CHANGELOG.md; config/database.php; pint.json; tests/Feature/DatabaseConfigTest.php; TRACEABILITY.md | tests/Feature/DatabaseConfigTest.php (2 tests) | Pint preset unsupported and database credentials mismatched with CI services, breaking lint and migrations. | Switched Pint to a supported preset, aligned CI MySQL/PostgreSQL secrets with Laravel config fallbacks, and added regression tests. |
| 18217747108 | package.json; tests/Unit/BuildConfigTest.php; CHANGELOG.md; TRACEABILITY.md | `tests/Unit/BuildConfigTest.php` (2 tests) | Node treated vite.config.js as CommonJS, so the ESM-only laravel-vite-plugin crashed the build. | Declared the project `type` as `module` and added tests guarding the ESM requirement. |
| local-php-artisan-test | .env.testing; phpunit.xml.dist; CHANGELOG.md; TRACEABILITY.md | Existing suite (`php artisan test`) | Missing `.env` forced the test runner to read MySQL secrets that are absent in CI. | Added a committed `.env.testing` profile and forced SQLite in PHPUnit to eliminate external dependencies. |
| 18252432946 | phpstan.neon; tests/Unit/StaticAnalysisConfigTest.php; CHANGELOG.md; TRACEABILITY.md | `tests/Unit/StaticAnalysisConfigTest.php` (2 tests) | Larastan v2 removed rules.neon, so PHPStan aborted when the config referenced a missing include. | Removed the obsolete include and added tests to ensure PHPStan includes map to real files. |
| E1-F5-I1 | app/Models/Message.php; app/Http/Controllers/Api/MessageController.php; app/Filament/Resources/MessageResource.php; config/logging.php; docs/OPENAPI.yaml | tests/Feature/MessageVisibilityTest.php (6 tests) | Messages lacked visibility separation, RBAC, and observability, so internal notes were indistinguishable from public replies. | Added author_role column, policies, API + Filament CRUD, structured logging, and OpenAPI/README docs for ticket message visibility. |
| E3-F1-I2 | app/Models/KbCategory.php; app/Http/Controllers/Api/KbArticleController.php; app/Services/KbArticleService.php; routes/api.php; docs/OPENAPI.yaml | tests/Feature/KnowledgeBaseApiTest.php (7 tests) | /api/v1/kb-categories; /api/v1/kb-articles | 2024_01_01_001100_create_kb_category_closure_table.php | Implemented brand-scoped knowledge base categories/articles with closure hierarchy, RBAC policies, Filament resources, audit logging, and updated docs. |
